File: Allows you to store files in Zope.
  
    Description

        This generic object can be used to store sound, video, and flash 
        files as well as Java applets in the Zope object database.
        **Note:** Remember that the ZODB is just a single file, and 
        the more pages you serve using the ZODB, the more of a bottle
        neck it becomes.
