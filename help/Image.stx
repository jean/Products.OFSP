Image - Store Image Files (GIF, PNG, JPG) in Zope
  
    Description

        The Image object allows you to store image files in Zope.
  
        Image objects differ from simple File objects. When displaying an
        Image you simply write '&lt;dtml var IMAGE_ID&gt;' and Zope
        will automatically generate an HTML 'IMG' tag with all the
        correct attributes. Read more in the API Documentation.
