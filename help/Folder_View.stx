Folder - View: Preview public appearance
  
    Description

        This view allows you to preview the public appearance of the folder.
  
        This view will only be available if the folder contains (or acquires) 
        an 'index_html' object. So, for example, if your root folder 
        contains an 'index_html', all of you Folders will have this 
        view.
