class PropertySheets:
    """

    A PropertySheet is an abstraction for organizing and working with
    a set of related properties. Conceptually it acts like a container
    for a set of related properties and meta-data describing those
    properties. PropertySheet objects are accessed through a
    PropertySheets object that acts as a collection of PropertySheet
    instances.

    Objects that support property sheets (objects that support the
    PropertyManager interface or ZClass objects) have a
    'propertysheets' attribute (a PropertySheets instance) that is the
    collection of PropertySheet objects. The PropertySheets object
    exposes an interface much like a Python mapping, so that
    individual PropertySheet objects may be accessed via
    dictionary-style key indexing.

    """
    
    def values():
        """

        Return a sequence of all of the PropertySheet objects for
        in the collection.

        Permission - Python only
        
        """

    def items():
        """
